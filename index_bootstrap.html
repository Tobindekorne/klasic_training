            "I cannot begin to express how lucky we are to have found Brittney.
            I was at the end of the rope with my chestnut mare (enough said) who
            had some significant behavioral issues including regular bucking.
            She had never been properly started and I really needed somebody to
            help us grow together. What I love about Brittney is that she is
            constantly trying new things to see what works best for Bella. She
            rides her first to get her safer for me, and then teaches me the
            skills under saddle that I was lacking. She is also just a very
            enjoyable person to be around. The bucking is fully resolved and the
            progress has been exceptional. I hope we can be lucky enough to keep
            her forever!"

            "Here we go... My mares and I began training with Brittney last
            October 2020. She comes 4 days a week in which she rides my mares
            and I get lessons twice a week. Brittney is an excellent rider. She
            is able to teach and impact confidence in both horses and rider. She
            stresses safety and correct positioning of the rider. She also
            thrives by exploring different exercises for my mares and myself to
            find balance as well as relaxation in the various movements needed
            in our Dressage training. Brittney is extremely conscientious about
            the horse's need. One of my mares has a very "special" temperament
            and with patience and tact Brittney has been able to give her the
            confidence and relaxation she needs and at the game time push her
            enough to meet her demands in training. Brittney is a very
            supportive and dedicated trainer, always conscious of and working
            with students individual needs. I highly recommend her!" Cristina B
